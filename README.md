Ping [@steipete](https://twitter.com/steipete) on Twitter or reach out via email (steipete at gmail) if you organize a conference where you'd like me to speak. I direct the day-to-day work as CEO of [PSPDFKit](https://pspdfkit.com) and also share knowledge on our [company blog](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/all/).

### Topics 2020

### Supporting Pointer Interactions in iPadOS 13.4 

With the just released iPadOS 13.4, Apple added support for trackpad and mouse devices! Watch me life-coding support for pointer interactions into a large project using Xcode 11.4 and Swift. You'll learn how the API works, how you can create bezier paths in-code (and what tools are there to help), and how to structure the handler in a way that is easy to read and extensive. We'll also discuss a few tricks and hacks how to make progress faster, how to make buttons react to events, and official and unofficual ways how to differentiate between finger touches and pointer taps.

This talk is based on my blog post [https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2020/supporting-pointer-interactions/](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2020/supporting-pointer-interactions/) but is much more hands-on and shows a few tricks we learned since then.

### Contributing to PDFium (exclusive for PDF Days 2020 Berlin)

Learn how PSPDFKit builds on and improves world’s most popular PDF library.

Companies like Google, Microsoft, Opera, LG and Dropbox are working together to commoditize PDF render technology. The future is open source, fast and fuzzed/well-tested.

We walk you through the many powerful features of PDFium, where it can be used, and how you can contribute to the most used PDF library in the world.

### Topics 2019

### Shipping a Mac Catalyst app: The good, the bad and the ugly

PSPDFKit ported [PDF Viewer](https://pdfviewer.io), a project with over 2 MLOC and lots of UIKit code to the Mac via Catalyst. Having played with "Marzipan" in 2018, the team was able to port their huge app in a relative short timeframe. Learn what you have to do after checking the [X] Mac checkbox, how far Catalyst can be pushed, how it interacts with AppKit, and how to work around the worst bugs. We'll show real code, a selection of r̵a̵d̵a̵r̵ Feedback Assistant items, strategies to keep code branching low, and some design alterations that were necessary to make it feel more at home on the Mac." ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xo3zGlyxXcI), [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/steipete/shipping-a-mac-catalyst-app-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly))

### How We Work at PSPDFKit

I explain our approach to SDK design, long-term product evolvement, feature/proposal development and support. This talk is interesting to developers and product planners alike. ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/steipete/how-we-work-at-pspdfkit), [blog post](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2019/how-we-work/))

### Should You Seek VC Money?

We discussed the up- and downsides of taking VC money vs boostrapping a business.
Many thanks to Natalie, Marcus, Anna for being great panel partners, the whole Pioneers team for being incredibly well organized and Florian for the tough audience question that later lead to an episode in his “Gründer&Zünder” podcast.

### Topics 2018

#### Hacking Marzipan

I will show the hacks currently needed to try Apple's new iOSMac platform, codenamed "Marzipan", and walk through what I needed to do to get [PDF Viewer](http://pdfviewer.io/) to run on macOS Mojave. Learn about the history, the current status, the timeline, and how to port your app today. [See preview research tweet](https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1006292370160316418)

#### Building Personal Brands for Introverts

Having a successful online identity will open many doors and help you to become a better developer, and person as a whole. I've been working on my professional persona since 2009, and it helped me so tremendously and pushed me forward into places I didn't think I could ever go.

This is the keynote talk for UIKonf for Day 2. [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/steipete/building-personal-brands-for-introverts) | [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c6izSzP-KQ)

#### Bootstrapping - The Long Road to Success

As part of the Founder & Investor Talks at Vienna University of Technology of 2018 I'll talk about my road from a freelancer to CEO of a succssful, growing international company with a deliberate choice of not taking VC money. This talk is about upsides/downsides and many lessions learned, the hard transition from "builder" to "manager", about teaming up with other people, building a team, core values, and strategies how to make a product work that sells B2B.

[I gave a variation of this talk as interview about Entrepreneurship at App Builders 2018 in Lugano. Watch here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ_BdSBxCZk)

#### Smart Debugging - Heavy Weapons for Hard Bugs

Debugging can be exciting, but often also very, very frustrating. We explore some lesser-known tools and techniques to find problems faster and make the Compiler mark issues, before they become a crash for the user. The second part is a case study of a particularily interesting bug hunts where I use some unconventional ways to find and resolve the issue.

#### Strategies for Binary Frameworks in Swift

Binary frameworks? Without ABI? In Swift? What’s the deal with Swift Modules? In his talk, Peter discusses binary frameworks and stability, when and why ABI matters, and why his team writes in Objective-C. Learn more about what you can do right now, what other companies are doing, common pitfalls, and the future.

### Topics 2017

#### Building a Sustainable Codebase: 7 Years and Counting

Peter will discuss strategies how code can be written in a way where you can both 'ship it' and have a sustainable product that allows you to move fast and where new people don't run away screaming. At least most of the time :)

The talk is based on lessons learned while building PSPDFKit for iOS since 2010, yet most parts will be applicable to any language and team.

### Bio

>Peter founded and bootstrapped PSPDFKit in 2011 and since then grew the company to 50 employees, with the goal of providing the highest quality PDF framework for all platforms. He stepped down as CEO in late 2019 and moved to a research role to focus on new products and technologies. His latest mission was becoming an expert in Apple's Project Catalyst. 
> Peter has worked with iOS since the inception of the iPhone, and is regularly invited to speak at conferences around the world. He also organizes [Cocoaheads](https://twitter.com/cocoaheads_at), a meetup for developers that work with Apple platforms. Prior to PSPDFKit, he worked as a Senior iOS Engineer at a startup in San Francisco and taught iOS and Mac development at his alma mater, the Vienna University of Technology.
