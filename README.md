Ping [@steipete](https://twitter.com/steipete) on Twitter or reach out via email (steipete at gmail) if you organize a conference where you'd like me to speak. I direct the day-to-day work as CEO of [PSPDFKit](https://pspdfkit.com) and also share knowledge on our [company blog](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/all/).

### 2018

#### Strategies for Binary Frameworks in Swift

Binary frameworks? Without ABI? In Swift? What’s the deal with Swift Modules? In his talk, Peter discusses binary frameworks and stability, when and why ABI matters, and why his team writes in Objective-C. Learn more about what you can do right now, what other companies are doing, common pitfalls, and the future.

#### Bootstrapping - The Long Road to Success

As part of the Founder & Investor Talks at Vienna University of Technology of 2018 I'll talk about my road from a freelancer to CEO of a succssful, growing international company with a deliberate choice of not taking VC money. This talk is about upsides/downsides and many lessions learned, the hard transition from "builder" to "manager", about teaming up with other people, building a team, core values, and strategies how to make a product work that sells B2B.

### 2017

#### Building a Sustainable Codebase: 7 Years and Counting.

Peter will discuss strategies how code can be written in a way where you can both 'ship it' and have a sustainable product that allows you to move fast and where new people don't run away screaming. At least most of the time :)

The talk is based on lessons learned while building PSPDFKit for iOS since 2010, yet most parts will be applicable to any language and team.

### Bio

>Peter founded and bootstrapped PSPDFKit GmbH in 2011, and has since expanded the company with the goal of providing the highest quality PDF framework for all platforms. While Peter is responsible for the day-to-day management of the team, he never misses the chance to go under PSPDFKit’s hood and improve upon the original code he wrote back in 2011. Peter has worked with iOS since the inception of the iPhone, and is regularly invited to speak at conferences around the world. Prior to PSPDFKit, he worked as a Senior iOS Engineer at a startup in San Francisco and taught iOS and Mac development at his alma mater, the Vienna University of Technology.
