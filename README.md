### Topics 2018

#### Hacking Marzipan

I will show the hacks currently needed to try Apple's new iOSMac platform, codenamed "Marzipan", and walk through what I needed to do to get [PDF Viewer](http://pdfviewer.io/) to run on macOS Mojave. Learn about the history, the current status, the timeline, and how to port your app today. [See preview research tweet](https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1006292370160316418)

Early version of this talk given [at mDevCamp 2018](https://twitter.com/mDevCamp/status/1007557562714279936), one week after the release of Marzipan. [Slides](https://speakerdeck.com/steipete/highlights-of-wwdc-2018-and-hacking-marzipan).

#### Building Personal Brands for Introverts

Having a successful online identity will open many doors and help you to become a better developer, and person as a whole. I've been working on my professional persona since 2009, and it helped me so tremendously and pushed me forward into places I didn't think I could ever go.

This is the keynote talk for UIKonf for Day 2. [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/steipete/building-personal-brands-for-introverts) | [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c6izSzP-KQ)

#### Bootstrapping - The Long Road to Success

As part of the Founder & Investor Talks at Vienna University of Technology of 2018 I'll talk about my road from a freelancer to CEO of a succssful, growing international company with a deliberate choice of not taking VC money. This talk is about upsides/downsides and many lessions learned, the hard transition from "builder" to "manager", about teaming up with other people, building a team, core values, and strategies how to make a product work that sells B2B.

[I gave a variation of this talk as interview about Entrepreneurship at App Builders 2018 in Lugano. Watch here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJ_BdSBxCZk)

#### Smart Debugging - Heavy Weapons for Hard Bugs

Debugging can be exciting, but often also very, very frustrating. We explore some lesser-known tools and techniques to find problems faster and make the Compiler mark issues, before they become a crash for the user. The second part is a case study of a particularily interesting bug hunts where I use some unconventional ways to find and resolve the issue.

#### Strategies for Binary Frameworks in Swift

Binary frameworks? Without ABI? In Swift? What‚Äôs the deal with Swift Modules? In his talk, Peter discusses binary frameworks and stability, when and why ABI matters, and why his team writes in Objective-C. Learn more about what you can do right now, what other companies are doing, common pitfalls, and the future.

### Topics 2017

#### Building a Sustainable Codebase: 7 Years and Counting

Peter will discuss strategies how code can be written in a way where you can both 'ship it' and have a sustainable product that allows you to move fast and where new people don't run away screaming. At least most of the time :)

The talk is based on lessons learned while building PSPDFKit for iOS since 2010, yet most parts will be applicable to any language and team.

### Bio

>Peter founded and bootstrapped PSPDFKit in 2011, and has since expanded the company with the goal of providing the highest quality PDF framework for all platforms. While Peter is responsible for the day-to-day management of the team, he never misses the chance to go under PSPDFKit‚Äôs hood and get his hands dirty with writing and debugging code. Peter has worked with iOS since the inception of the iPhone, and is regularly invited to speak at conferences around the world. He also organizes [Cocoaheads](https://twitter.com/cocoaheads_at), a meetup for developers that work with Apple platforms. Prior to PSPDFKit, he worked as a Senior iOS Engineer at a startup in San Francisco and taught iOS and Mac development at his alma mater, the Vienna University of Technology.
