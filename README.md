# Speaking
I love teaching, sharing and talking at conferences.

Ping [@steipete](https://twitter.com/steipete) on Twitter or send me an email at steipete at google dot com if you organize a conference where you'd like me to speak. I love sharing knowledge, [nowadays mostly on our company blog](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/all/) as my day work as CEO of [PSPDFKit](https://pspdfkit.com) is quite time consuming. But asking never hurts :)
