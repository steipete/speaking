### What Nobody Tells You When Selling Your Business

This talk was originally written for Deep Dish Swift 2023. I also gave a (majorly) modified version of this talk at iOS Conf SG 2024 in Singapore.

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Yiqa8u3DaY)

Description from [Daniel Saidi, one of the attendees](https://danielsaidi.com/blog/2023/05/01/deep-dish-swift-day-2): 

Peter from PSPDFKit talked about how he sold his company, and how the last two years have been the hardest of his life. Starting his first app out of rage, and later his first company, Peter founded PSPDFKit, which over time has turned into a pretty big thing.

This talk was not a success story of formula 1A talk, rather the opposite. It was a many-faceted, rich and deeply touching description about what it’s like to start a company, reach success and start to grow, then feeling the loss of control as more people are brought in, having to battle with separating your identity from your company and product, conflicts, burning out etc. Eventually, selling the thing you’ve identified with for so long can have some nasty surprises up its sleeve. Who are you when you sell a large part of who you consider yourself to be? Who are you in that deep void, when you have no sense of purpose?

This talk went deep and dark, but ended with rich insights on how to find yourself after such a journey.

I loved it.

Wasn’t expecting to tear up at a tech conference, but here we are :pray:" (via Slack), Nick Hayward: "Excellent talk!", Patrick McCarron: "Thanks so much as someone who has struggled with burn out and depression over the years I loved the additional tips and tools to look into to learn even more about the why it happened.", ["Super thoughtful and thought-provoking keynote"](https://twitter.com/gabrielsavit/status/1653054878430765056?s=61&t=IrSUBSFexGEzYYNfMAHtFw), ["Company success, beating health issues, experience burnout, selling his company, feeling lost - the hedonic treadmill"](https://twitter.com/suziebytes/status/1653043648815067138?s=61&t=IrSUBSFexGEzYYNfMAHtFw), ["Wow @steipete just mentioned Three20 and ASIHTTPRequest.

### Earlier Topics

### Mobile at a Crossroads: The Declarative UI App Revolution

There’s a shift happening in how mobile apps are built—again. While a few years ago we moved from languages created in the 1980s and ʼ90s (think Objective-C and Java) toward more modern and expressive programming languages (Swift and Kotlin), we’re now seeing the transition from imperative to declarative UI frameworks in the form of SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose. This once again promises to dramatically increase developer productivity.
To understand declarative UI’s present potential, it helps to start by exploring its not-too-distant past. Along the way, we’ll look at how it’s empowering developers to build apps faster with less code, and why now is the right time to consider adopting SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose.

This talk was first presented at [WeAreDevelopers World Congress 2021](https://app.swapcard.com/widget/event/wearedevelopers-world-congress/planning/UGxhbm5pbmdfNTU2ODkw) [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/steipete/mobile-at-a-crossroads-the-declarative-ui-app-revolution)

### SwiftUI In Production

With the 10.3 release of our iOS PDF SDK, we’re shipping SwiftUI in production. This is a big milestone for us, and an even more interesting one, as our product still supports iOS 12. In this talk I'll explain how we built this feature while also keep things working for iOS 12, and why we picked SwiftUI for it.

Feedback: "Wow, nice talk Peter! Thanks a lot for setting it up! The keyboard avoidance trick was really cool to see 🚀" [@kkostov](https://twitter.com/kkostov), [@steipete Absolutely fantastic presentation on SwiftUI Peter! We also saw a lot of those SwiftUI 1.0 issues in the app we’re building at work, so it was really great to see it wasn’t just us! 🤣 Thanks so much for that!](https://twitter.com/timoliverau/status/1382970288099315715?s=21), [After seeing @steipete talk this morning I feel less sad about the bugs in Mocka. Pure SwiftUI is hell 🤷](https://twitter.com/inkedengineer/status/1382966618972643328?s=21), [Amazing @steipete SwiftUI talk at @swiftheroes_it, what a chain of hacks are being shown. Mind = .blown](https://twitter.com/minuscorp/status/1382965143093575682?s=21), [Congrats on your talk @steipete @swiftheroes_it. Thanks for sharing your experiences. Makes me we wanna pull the breaks on adopting SwiftUI a bit until we can drop iOS13 on our projects.](https://twitter.com/objective_cesar/status/1382971429201793028?s=21), [that was a great talk, as usual from @steipete :)](https://twitter.com/merowing_/status/1382983679178330113?s=21), ["Really enjoyed your talk @steipete some great tips on mixing UIKit and SwiftUI"](https://twitter.com/JamesSwiney/status/1387565154833813504)

This talk has been made for Swift Heroes 2021. [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/steipete/swiftui-in-production) [video](https://vimeo.com/536908653)

A revised version of this talk has been presented at [WeAreDevelopers Live 2021](https://twitter.com/WeAreDevs/status/1387383849441710080)

### Continuous Integration for the Rest of Us

Every project benefits from a good Continuous Integration & Delivery system. While there's countless articles on the latest Swift or SwiftUI tricks, there's surprisingly little talk about strategies around CI & CD. You will find case studies by industry giants like Shopify or Uber that talk about their solutions, however their CI/CD team in many cases is larger than some middle-sized companies.

At PSPDFKit, we don't have a separate team for CI/CD, our engineering team also owns testing and delivery. In this talk I'll give you an overview of the options today, and will explore what path we took for fast, automated testing in a multi-platform environment. We'll also talk about money, because running cost is an important topic for bootstrapped companies. Lastly, we'll look at options around configuration management tools to automate machine setups.

This talk was made for iOS Conf SG 2021. [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/steipete/continuous-integration-for-the-rest-of-us) [video](https://vimeo.com/503127515)

Feedback from Attendees via Zoom: "thank you. great talk." "Peter! I'm impressed by your optimism :)" "Super cool the script about removing default apps, adding that to my dot files!" "Honestly installing Xcode on just one machine does it for me!" ["Thank you Peter, amazing talk 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻"](https://twitter.com/zntfdr/status/1352569199705513985?s=21)

### Topics 2020

### Building a PDF Viewer in 40 Minutes (aka Wrapping a Complex View Controller in SwiftUI)

Follow me along as I take the main view controller of PSPDFKit and wrap it into a SwiftUI view, add custom configuration properties, make methods on the view controller accessible via Combine publishers, use a Coordinator to wrap the delegate into modern closures and call pre-built popovers from a SwiftUI Navigation Bar. This will be a Xcode coding session where I explain the concepts as I'm building the component. We look at tradeoffs with iOS 13 vs iOS 14 compatibility, some tricks to work around bugs, SwiftUI lifetime, considerations for Combine cancellables and much more.

Feedback via Brella: Tim Oliver: Oh man. Damn that's impressive Peter!, Cristina De: Thank you very much Peter! 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻, Moein Barzegaran: Thanks Peter!, Sammy Smallman: Thanks Peter, that was awesome!, Nissi Miranda: Very good! 😄, Fernando Bunn: Really awesome talk Peter.

This talk was hand-crafted and recorded for Swift Heroes Digital 2020. [video](https://vimeo.com/463560058)

### UI Testing over the years

UI testing has been around since iOS 4, but it never really caught on. I've asked various members of the iOS community about their experience and tips. Join me on a trip of different frameworks, strategies and tools to find a solution that fits your app. You will hear about KIF, EarlGrey, XCU and various open source projects to help you write better tests, to parallelize them or even to remind you to write tests. "
Feedback via hopin.to: [Daniel Steinberg](https://twitter.com/dimsumthinking): nice job @Peter Steinberger thanks, Alexander Lonsky thanks Peter!, Thomas Besnehard: 👏👏👏👏, Hugo Saynac: Congrats, great talk 👏, Heiko Goes: Thanks a lot Peter for this extensive overview, Seán Labastille (Organizer): 👏 👏 👏 👏, Shai Mishal: Great overview, thanks !, Vincent Pradeilles: Thank you!, Paris Buttfield-Addison: Fabulous talk, thanks!, Andrea Antonioni: Great talk!!, Andreas Hegenberg: 👍👍 very nice!, Eben Kok: That was awesome!, Alexander Weiß: Very interesting talk !, Martin Fitzka-Reichart: Great talk Peter!!, Matej Malesevic: thanks a lot 👏👏👏, ["very informative talk about UI testing."](https://twitter.com/ekurutepe/status/1259781082225967105?s=21),  ["When can I watch this over and over again please?"](https://twitter.com/ashtondev/status/1259788241005211649?s=21)

### Supporting Pointer Interactions in iPadOS 13.4 

With the just released iPadOS 13.4, Apple added support for trackpad and mouse devices! Watch me life-coding support for pointer interactions into a large project ([PSPDFKit](https://pspdfkit.com/), a PDF SDK) using Xcode 11.4 and Swift. You'll learn how the API works, how you can create bezier paths in-code (and what tools are there to help), and how to structure the handler in a way that is easy to read and extensive. We'll also discuss a few tricks and hacks how to make progress faster, how to make buttons react to events, and official and unofficual ways how to differentiate between finger touches and pointer taps.

This talk is based on my blog post [https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2020/supporting-pointer-interactions/](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/2020/supporting-pointer-interactions/) but is much more hands-on and shows a few tricks we learned since then.

Feedback from Attendees: (Via ClickMeeting Platform) Tiago Mergulhão: OMG! SO COOL!, Christian Beer: One more thing! Thank you very much, Peter! That was really awesome!!, Akshat Patel: hahaha now THIS looks like real code, Stefan Steinbauer: Thanks for the ride, Nico du Plessis: Awesome session!, Liviu C: haha. nice tweak!, Mostafa: Thank you 👏, J.B.: *Good stuff, Peter, Mosbah: That was really cool thx !, Joao Pereira: great stuff! Thanks Peter & the organizers, Alexander: Peter, thank you very much! I'm always amazed at how you instantly manage to support new things, very grateful for doing pioneer work. By the way, besides this webinar and the aforementioned blog post by Peter I can highly recommend Apple's HIG article covering pointers in user interaction chapter and pretty decent sample code "Integrating Pointer Interactions into Your iPad App"., Gerry (WeAreDevelopers): Great session, thank you Peter!, Tamas Jaroli: Thank you Peter, this was amazing!, Eben: Pete that was epic!, Sead: Thanks Peter, it was awesome!

### Topics 2019

### Shipping a Mac Catalyst app: The good, the bad and the ugly

PSPDFKit ported [PDF Viewer](https://pdfviewer.io), a project with over 2 MLOC and lots of UIKit code to the Mac via Catalyst. Having played with "Marzipan" in 2018, the team was able to port their huge app in a relative short timeframe. Learn what you have to do after checking the [X] Mac checkbox, how far Catalyst can be pushed, how it interacts with AppKit, and how to work around the worst bugs. We'll show real code, a selection of r̵a̵d̵a̵r̵ Feedback Assistant items, strategies to keep code branching low, and some design alterations that were necessary to make it feel more at home on the Mac."

#### Smart Debugging - Heavy Weapons for Hard Bugs

Debugging can be exciting, but often also very, very frustrating. We explore some lesser-known tools and techniques to find problems faster and make the Compiler mark issues, before they become a crash for the user. The second part is a case study of a particularily interesting bug hunts where I use some unconventional ways to find and resolve the issue.

Binary frameworks? Without ABI? In Swift? What’s the deal with Swift Modules? In his talk, Peter discusses binary frameworks and stability, when and why ABI matters, and why his team writes in Objective-C. Learn more about what you can do right now, what other companies are doing, common pitfalls, and the future.

### Topics 2017

#### Building a Sustainable Codebase: 7 Years and Counting

Peter will discuss strategies how code can be written in a way where you can both 'ship it' and have a sustainable product that allows you to move fast and where new people don't run away screaming. At least most of the time :)

The talk is based on lessons learned while building PSPDFKit for iOS since 2010, yet most parts will be applicable to any language and team.

### Bio

>Peter worked with iOS since the inception of the iPhone and is an experienced speaker both on highly technical and management topics. He bootstrapped PSPDFKit in 2011 and made a successful exit in 2021. Prior to PSPDFKit, he worked as a Senior iOS Engineer at a startup in San Francisco and taught iOS and Mac development at his alma mater, the Vienna University of Technology. After a longer sabbatical, he's now looking for a new challenge.
