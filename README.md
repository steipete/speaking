# Speaking
I love teaching, sharing and talking at conferences.

Ping [@steipete](https://twitter.com/steipete) on Twitter or send me an email at steipete at google dot com if you organize a conference where you'd like me to speak. I love sharing knowledge, [nowadays mostly on our company blog](https://pspdfkit.com/blog/all/) as my day work as CEO of [PSPDFKit](https://pspdfkit.com) is quite time consuming. But asking never hurts :)

### 2018

#### Strategies for Binary Frameworks in Swift

Binary frameworks? Without ABI? And what’s the deal with Modules? Learn about what you can do right now, what other companies are doing, common pitfalls and the future. 

As apps become more complex, there's more need for separation of concerns and potentially even outsourcing specific functionality to other companies _or_ providing such SDKs to other parties. There are many reasons why source code cannot always be shared and it's important to know about the limitations, and ABI stability alone will not fix these problems.

#### Bootstrapping - The Long Road to Success

As part of the Founder & Investor Talks at Vienna University of Technology of 2018 I'll talk about my road from a freelancer to CEO of a succssful, growing international company with a deliberate choice of not taking VC money. This talk is about upsides/downsides and many lessions learned.

### 2017

#### Building a Sustainable Codebase: 7 Years and Counting.

Peter will discuss strategies how code can be written in a way where you can both 'ship it' and have a sustainable product that allows you to move fast and where new people don't run away screaming. At least most of the time :)

The talk is based on lessons learned while building PSPDFKit for iOS since 2010, yet most parts will be applicable to any language and team.

### Bio

>Peter founded and bootstrapped PSPDFKit GmbH in 2011 and has since gradually expanded the company with the goal of providing the highest quality PDF Framework to mobile. While Peter is responsible for the day-to-day management of the team, he never misses the chance to go under PSPDFKit's hood and continue to improve on the original code he wrote back in 2011.
>Peter has worked with iOS since the inception of the iPhone and regularly gets invited to speak at various iOS and mobile conferences throughout the world. Prior to PSPDFKit, he worked as a Senior iOS Engineer at a startup in San Francisco and taught iOS and Mac development at the Vienna University of Technology, from which he graduated.
